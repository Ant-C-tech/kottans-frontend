## Git Basics

- One thing that was new to me: I used to think that GIT is "git add ." + "git commit -m "some comments" + "git push". I absolutely did not understand the difference between GIT and GitHub.
- One thing that surprised me: It turns, I do not now anything about GIT AT ALL.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: Now I like GIT. It seems to me very flexible and useful. I will try to improve my level of using GIT in the future with right branches and commits.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

#### Linux Survival

- One thing that was new to me: it was absolutely new topic for me because all I could do with command terminal was "cd"-command. Now I know much more about it, so I think I will feel more confident with terminal in the future.
- One thing that surprised me: I do not know yet why I need Linux CLI but I trust kottans teacher because last theme (Git Basics) was very useful for me and showed me the gaps in my knowledges.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: I think "man"-command will help me resolve any problem with terminal.

#### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know

 I cannot call the material presented in two parts of the article absolutely new for me, but this time the immersion into the material was much deeper than a simple listing of the server response status codes. I hope that repeated reading of the material allowed me to create a certain theoretical foundation, which will become the beginning of a deeper study of this topic for next practical creating of REST services.

 ## Git Collaboration

 #### GitHub & Collaboration - Udacity course

After studying "Learn Git Branching - Remote", this Udacity course was mostly like some addition with deeper studying "git rebase" command. Anyway, all GIT-materials was very useful for me and I am sure I will come back to them many times in future to make my GIT technique perfect at the end.

I heard a lot about this game but I have never been playing it before. So, it was quite easy to won it except level 24 (that's because in my practice I never used property "wrap-reverse"). Long story short, first easy task in this course. Thanks, because it is Saturday today.

## HTML & CSS practice

I used to made dropdown menu with pure css but it was the first time when  this technique seems to me very convenient. It was a good practice.
Again I did not pay my attention to notice from tutors). They said "Make sure you've added empty lines in each file from your PR - reason. If you forget to add an empty line at the end of the file GitHub will show it:". So, I had some problem with my pull request. [Demo](https://ant-c-tech.github.io/-5-HTML-CSS-Practice/)

#### FreeCodeCamp exercises

- One thing that was new to me: Next themes was new for me: "Rest Parameter", "Spread Operator", "Destructuring". Actually, I have read them before but I did not examine these themes deep and didn't use them in my practice. One more thing that I noticed, there was information about "Promice". Unfortunatelly, it was too little and I hope we will study it in next lessons.
- One thing that surprised me: I have very liked exercises from "freeCodeCamp". Unlike "CodeWars" where I have "kata 5" and where exercises are or too difficult or too easy these exercises were picked up evenly with small increasing of difficulty.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: I am planning to finished course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)" from "freeCodeCamp" after "Stage 0".

#### Practical task

Unfortunately, I have spent too much time for this task. Let's accelerating! I want to thanks Bohdan Kovalchuk for his review. It made me thought again about many aspects of my code. I formerly worked as an engineer and I good undestanding how it is boring to check students works. But for me I think this code review was the most important part of this course. Now I understand why nobody wants to work with people without experience. Bohdan made greate job. [Demo](https://ant-c-tech.github.io/-7-Document-Object-Model-Practice/)

## Object-Oriented JavaScript

#### Object Oriented JS - Udacity course

This Udacity course for me was like some Evolution Theory of JavaScript OOP. It was the way to combine my fragmentary knowledge together that I recieved earlier. Now I feel like I know more about OOP, but low level of understanding Lesson 10 (Prototype chains) do not let me to feel myself more comfort in these themes. I understand that I will return to this material later.
