## Git Basics

- One thing that was new to me: I used to think that GIT is "git add ." + "git commit -m "some comments" + "git push". I absolutely did not understand the difference between GIT and GitHub.
- One thing that surprised me: It turns, I do not now anything about GIT AT ALL.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: Now I like GIT. It seems to me very flexible and useful. I will try to improve my level of using GIT in the future with right branches and commits.

## Linux CLI and HTTP

#### Linux Survival

- One thing that was new to me: it was absolutely new topic for me because all I could do with command terminal was "cd"-command. Now I know much more about it, so I think I will feel more confident with terminal in the future.
- One thing that surprised me: I do not know yet why I need Linux CLI but I trust kottans teacher because last theme (Git Basics) was very useful for me and showed me the gaps in my knowledges.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: I think "man"-command will help me resolve any problem with terminal.

#### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know

 I cannot call the material presented in two parts of the article absolutely new for me, but this time the immersion into the material was much deeper than a simple listing of the server response status codes. I hope that repeated reading of the material allowed me to create a certain theoretical foundation, which will become the beginning of a deeper study of this topic for next practical creating of REST services.

 ## Git Collaboration

 #### GitHub & Collaboration - Udacity course

After studying "Learn Git Branching - Remote", this Udacity course was mostly like some addition with deeper studying "git rebase" command. Anyway, all GIT-materials was very useful for me and I am sure I will come back to them many times in future to make my GIT technique perfect at the end.

#### Learn Git Branching

I studied this set of lessons with part #0 Git Basic. So my emotions after studying were something like this:

- One thing that was new to me: I used to think that GIT is "git add ." + "git commit -m "some comments" + "git push". I absolutely did not understand the difference between GIT and GitHub.
- One thing that surprised me: It turns, I do not now anything about GIT AT ALL.
- One thing I intend to use in the future: Now I like GIT. It seems to me very flexible and useful. I will try to improve my level of using GIT in the future with right branches and commits.
