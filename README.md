## `Git Basics` <span id="task0"></span>

- *One thing that was new to me*: I used to think that GIT is "git add ." + "git commit -m "some comments" + "git push". I absolutely did not understand the difference between GIT and GitHub.
- *One thing that surprised me*: It turns, I do not now anything about GIT AT ALL.
- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: Now I like GIT. It seems to me very flexible and useful. I will try to improve my level of using GIT in the future with right branches and commits.

## `Linux CLI and HTTP` <span id="task1"></span>

### [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/)

- *One thing that was new to me*: it was absolutely new topic for me because all I could do with command terminal was "cd"-command. Now I know much more about it, so I think I will feel more confident with terminal in the future.
- *One thing that surprised me*: I do not know yet why I need Linux CLI but I trust Kottans teacher because last theme (Git Basics) was very useful for me and showed me the gaps in my knowledges.
- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: I think "man"-command will help me resolve any problem with terminal.

### [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know. Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)
### [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know. Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

 I cannot call the material presented in two parts of the article absolutely new for me, but this time the immersion into the material was much deeper than a simple listing of the server response status codes. I hope that repeated reading of the material allowed me to create a certain theoretical foundation, which will become the beginning of a deeper study of this topic for next practical creating of REST services.

### `Extras`

##### [Command Line Basics (RUS) - Hexlet course](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/cli-basics)

I liked this course because it gave me more confidence in my work with IDE terminal. One more thing - practical part was not difficult, so I liked it. It is very pleasant when you do something correct.

##### [HTTP: A protocol that every web developer should understand. Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

Reading this article improved my knowledge about HTTP one more time. Earlier I did not notice some details or just did not understand them properly. But still I have some difficulties with understanding of practical using these data. Until now I did not made any requests just "fetch" in my "Friends App". I hope next practices give me more material for comprehending and studying and I will catch the purpose of such articles. At the moment for me it is a bit abstraction knowledge.

##### [How I Taught Myself to Code in Eight Weeks](https://lifehacker.com/how-i-taught-myself-to-code-in-eight-weeks-511615189)

 I think that the best in this article is this words: "It goes without saying that there’s a huge difference between the relatively cursory amount of knowledge needed to build a simple prototype (the focus of this post) and the depth of knowledge and experience needed to be a truly qualified software engineer.".

##### [How JavaScript works: Deep dive into WebSockets and HTTP/2](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-deep-dive-into-websockets-and-http-2-with-sse-how-to-pick-the-right-path-584e6b8e3bf7)

I had many difficulties with this article. First, it's English was too complicated for me, the second was that the material itself was new  and difficult for me. Anyway, it was interesting and I hope useful. I am planning to return one day and read all set of articles from this author.

##### [Configuring Linux Web Servers - Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/configuring-linux-web-servers--ud299)

I had some difficulties with this task. First of all I had Windows 10 Home that doesn't support Hyper V so I couldn't use virtual machine with my PC. I changed the version of my operation system to Windows 10 Pro for Workstations. And then I had troubles with installing VirtualBox and Vagrant. Udacity doesn't give enough information to do it. So I spent a lot of time collecting information that I need. Anyway, it was very interesting and useful course.

This course was a good way to understand of basics of Internet's work like Netcat using, names and addresses, firewals, etc. Moreover all the course I had the opportunity practicing with Linux terminal so my Ubuntu from course before was useful. Even through it was sometimes a bit complicated the course was interesting and helpful for my next steps.

## `Git Collaboration` <span id="task2"></span>

### [GitHub & Collaboration - Udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)

After studying "Learn Git Branching - Remote", this Udacity course was mostly like some addition with deeper studying "git rebase" command. Anyway, all GIT-materials was very useful for me and I am sure I will come back to them many times in future to make my GIT technique perfect at the end.

### [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=ru_RU)

I studied this set of lessons with part #0 Git Basic. So my emotions after studying were something like this:

- *One thing that surprised me*: It turns, I do not now anything about GIT AT ALL.

### `Extras`

##### [An Introduction to Git and GitHub by Brian Yu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJUJ4wbFm_A&feature=youtu.be)

It was a good seminar. One thing I want to mentioned is that after all courses and quizzes in tasks "Git intro" and "Git for Team Collaboration" that I did before, particularly after all practical task that I did (because I made this task after the end of Stage0), after all code reviews that mentors made for my code and fixing all the mistakes this information seemed a bit like basics of using Git. But, anyway, thanks authors of this FrontEnd course for this great material.

##### [Oh shit, git!](https://ohshitgit.com/)

I like when it is useful and so funny. Cool article.

##### [Flight rules for git](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)

It is one of the most completed manual for Git troubles. One part of these issues I have already been faced, another part I can imagine that I would face in nearest future. Unequivocally I save this repo because I am sure it would be very helpful for me.

## `HTML & CSS practice` <span id="task5"></span>

I used to made dropdown menu with pure css but it was the first time when  this technique seems to me very convenient. It was a good practice.
Again I did not pay my attention to notice from tutors). They said "Make sure you've added empty lines in each file from your PR - reason. If you forget to add an empty line at the end of the file GitHub will show it:". So, I had some problem with my pull request.

- *One thing that was new to me*: Next themes was new for me: "Rest Parameter", "Spread Operator", "Destructuring". Actually, I have read them before but I did not examine these themes deep and didn't use them in my practice. One more thing that I noticed, there was information about "Promice". Unfortunately, it was too little and I hope we will study it in next lessons.
- *One thing that surprised me*: I have very liked exercises from "freeCodeCamp". Unlike "CodeWars" where I have "Kata 5" and where exercises are or too difficult or too easy these exercises were picked up evenly with small increasing of difficulty.
- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: I am planning to finished course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)" from "freeCodeCamp" after "Stage 0".

- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: all knowledges that was received with this course are vitally important in my practice so I think I will use all of them in my projects constantly.

### `Practical task`

Unfortunately, I have spent too much time for this task. Let's accelerating! I want to thanks Bohdan Kovalchuk for his review. It made me thought again about many aspects of my code. I formerly worked as an engineer and I good understanding how it is boring to check students works. But for me I think this code review was the most important part of this course. Now I understand why nobody wants to work with people without experience. Bohdan made a great job.

## `Object-Oriented JavaScript` <span id="task9"></span>

### [Object Oriented JS - Udacity course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud015)

This Udacity course for me was like some Evolution Theory of JavaScript OOP. It was the way to combine my fragmentary knowledge together that I received earlier. Now I feel like I know more about OOP, but low level of understanding Lesson 10 (Prototype chains) do not let me to feel myself more comfort in these themes. I understand that I will return to this material later.

With this task I got a set of articles that helped me to start my way in OOP. It is a good start but there is a lot of work and practice in the feature to feel at least the same confident that using functional programming. I am sure I will get this opportunity with "Kottans".

[<img src="https://github.com/Ant-C-tech/kottans-frontend/blob/master/demo/scr3.jpg">](https://ant-c-tech.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/)

In fact,  the "Tiny JS world" and its "Post-OOP" part for me was the most difficult task in this course. Sometimes the hope that one day I will finally do it properly left me. Anyway, I understand that my solution for this task  was approve as in advance and I will try to work more hardly to comprehend this Zen in my next steps. I want to thanks Oleksiy Rudenko for his reviews and patient in work with my code.

## `Offline Web Applications` <span id="task11"></span>

### [Offline Web Applications - Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)

- *One thing that was new to me*: I very liked this course. I have never heard before about "offline-first" conception. Even though I failed to got opportunity to worked with education  application "Wittr" because of the version conflict my NPM and application's Gulp I could got the structural knowledges about implementation "offline-first" conception with any application I need.
- *One thing that surprised me*: I used to work with Local Storage with my previous educational projects (like "Personal Scheduling Service" for example) but now I know about IDB, its methods and possibilities, and I think it opens new   ways to implement much scale projects in my future actions.
- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: I hope I will have chance to study this material more deeply, have a lot of practice with it and then I think I would use it in my projects constantly.

## `Memory – Pair Game` <span id="task12"></span>

I thank Maksym Kalashnyk for his time and work with my code. Code review is very important for me and always makes my code better.
Having pay attention to his notices about using event delegation and template strings, I tried to implement them both by reconstruction my app. I hope that this deep changes didn't make his work harder with checking my code.

## `Website Performance Optimization` <span id="task13"></span>

### [Front-End Performance Checklist 2019](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/front-end-performance-checklist-2019-pdf-pages/)

When I started study HTML and CSS I have spent a lot of time learning Site Performance and conducting experiments on my landings with Google Page Speed to change performance index of them. Now it is obviously that some things I was doing correct, some things I was doing wrong, but I even did not know about most of patterns. Now I have a whole science named "Front-End Performance". It will takes a lot of time to study it but it is necessary. Thanks author and Kottans for this article.

### [Website Performance Optimization - Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/website-performance-optimization--ud884)

Now I have the list of simple rules to optimizate my sites and I know how use Network tab of DevTools. These knowledges open many ways to practice with Google SpeedPage and other apps for analysing the performance of my projects.

### [Inside a super fast CSS engine: Quantum CSS (aka Stylo)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/)

With this article I have started better understood building of CSSOM and working of CSS engine of browser. During the reading I always wanted to install this wonderful browser Mozilla and I have always remember that I have it and it is very slow and boring)

### [Browser Rendering Optimization - Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860)

- *One thing that was new to me*: I have never heard before about "will-change" CSS property and it looks like using it is very good idea improve performance of the app. I watched many ru-chanels about creating of simple web pages like landings or so, but nobody didn't even mention about it.
- *One thing that surprised me*: I couldn't suggest that using BEM methodology may improve web page performance that much that we would see it.
- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: Dev Tools doesn't not stop  surprise me. How many cool features it has! Unfortunately, professors in course use some old version of Chrome, so I have to find some newer material about it. Cool, that now I know what I need to find. And of course I need to know more about requestAnimationFrame() method.

### [Responsive Images - Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882)

I used try to figure out how to use a "picture" tag and attribute "srcset" when I did my first steps with landings. Honestly, with russian language resources it was difficult to do. Now I have a step-by-step manual to make it properly and I can't wait to try it and get cool SpeedPage index.

### [Animation on GPU: do it correctly](https://habr.com/ru/company/odnoklassniki/blog/313978/)

Once again these magic "transform: translateZ(0)" and "will-change". I need help - I need practice. However, now the way is obvious. It was very useful article for me.

#### [Web performance example](https://habr.com/ru/company/infobox/blog/226289/)

- *One thing that was new to me*:

`<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//hostname_to_resolve.com">`

`<link rel="subresource"  href="/javascript/myapp.js">`

`<link rel="prefetch"     href="/images/big.jpeg">`

`<link rel="prerender"    href="//example.org/next_page.html">`

- *One thing that surprised me*: "...we are not limited by the channel width. The problem is the latency between client and server."

- *One thing I intend to use in the future*: This article operates with complex concepts that will take time to fully understand.

### [Asynchronous versus deferred JavaScript](https://habr.com/ru/post/323790/)

The technique of choosing between the "async" and "defer" attributes of the "script" tag is explained and argued in a cool and accessible way.

## `Friends App` <span id="task14"></span>

When I was starting to do this task I have remembered that I have always wanted to try some library with google like styles and some basic functionality. I have chosen MaterializeCss and it was the biggest mistake. Those problems that I have got did not cost it. When I was finishing my work with this task I have noticed, that I almost did not use any possibility of this library because I just did not need them instead I have many troubles with positioning elements with float that use MaterializeCss. Long story short "Never again".
I want to thank Ivan Tytarenko for his time and work with review of my code. I have tried to make all changes according his notices and video of AMA helped me very much. It was forgetless experience for me and I am sure that it gave me huge new knowledges that I did not have before.

<h3 align="center">Resume</h3>

In the course I liked a thorough approach to the selection of material - a huge number of very useful materials and courses, the opportunity to improve the level of technical and spoken English (course materials, communication with mentors in GitHub), and, of course, code review from mentors - experience, which can hardly be obtained anywhere else but real work.
